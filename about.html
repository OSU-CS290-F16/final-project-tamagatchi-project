            The Tamagotchi is a handheld digital pet, created in Japan by Akihiro Yokoi of WiZ and Aki Maita of Bandai. It was first
            sold by Bandai on November 23, 1996 in Japan, quickly becoming one of the biggest toy fads of the 1990s. As of
            2010, over 76 million Tamagotchis have been sold world-wide. Most Tamagotchi are housed in a small egg-shaped
            computer with an interface usually consisting of three buttons, although the number of buttons may vary. <br><br>Source: Wikipedia
